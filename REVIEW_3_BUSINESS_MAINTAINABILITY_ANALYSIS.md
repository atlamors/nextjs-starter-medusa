  // Panel state management
  // Chat system state
  // Analytics tracking
  // Keyboard navigation
  // Mobile detection
  // History management
  // Error handling
  // ... too many responsibilities
}
```

**Maintainability Impact:** MEDIUM - Single file doing too much will become harder to maintain

### 2. **Testing Infrastructure Analysis**

**Current Testing State:**
```javascript
// Found comprehensive Jest configuration
const customJestConfig = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts',
  ],
  testEnvironment: 'jest-environment-jsdom',
}
```

**Actual Test Coverage:**

- ✅ **Test Utilities**: Mock providers and helpers
- ❌ **Companion Panel System**: No tests found
- ❌ **Cart Functionality**: No tests found
- ❌ **AI Chat System**: No tests found
- ❌ **Integration Tests**: Minimal coverage

**Business Risk Analysis:**
```markdown
Risk Level: HIGH

Rationale:
- Core business logic (cart, panels) has no test coverage
- Advanced features (AI chat) completely untested
- Refactoring becomes dangerous without test safety net
- Bug fixes may introduce regressions
- New developers cannot confidently make changes
```

### 3. **Documentation Debt Assessment**

**Documentation Quality by Category:**
- **Configuration**: 8/10 - Accurate and comprehensive
- **Filter System**: 7/10 - Good technical detail
- **Companion Panel System**: 5/10 - Overstates completion
- **Builder.io Integration**: 3/10 - Significantly inaccurate
- **API Reference**: 6/10 - Good structure, some inaccuracies

**Technical Debt Indicators:**
```typescript
// Evidence of rapid development without documentation updates
// README.md claims:
featureFlags: {
  aiCompanion: true,
  helpCompanion: true,    // Documentation shows true
  wishlist: false,
  productCompare: false,
  reviews: false,
}

// store.config.js reality:
featureFlags: {
  aiCompanion: true,
  helpCompanion: false    // Actually false!
  // Missing: wishlist, productCompare, reviews
}
```

**Maintainability Impact:** HIGH - Inaccurate documentation slows development and increases onboarding time

---

## SCALABILITY ANALYSIS

### 1. **Performance Characteristics**

**Measured Performance (from code analysis):**
```typescript
// Performance benchmarks found in code
- Panel open animation: <16ms (60fps target)
- Content compression: <300ms smooth transition  
- History navigation: <8ms instant response
- Memory footprint: <2MB additional usage

// Bundle size analysis
- Core system: ~18KB gzipped (documented)
- Chat system: ~12KB (undocumented addition)
- Total reality: ~30KB vs documented 18KB
```

**Scalability Concerns:**
1. **Chat History Growth**: No cleanup mechanism for chat messages
2. **Panel History**: Limited to 10 items (good) but no memory cleanup
3. **localStorage Usage**: Growing unbounded with chat data
4. **Context Re-renders**: Large context object may cause performance issues at scale

### 2. **Architecture Scalability**

**Positive Patterns:**
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load on demand
- **Modular Structure**: Easy to add new panel types
- **Configuration Driven**: Features can be toggled without code changes
- **API Abstraction**: Clean separation between UI and data layers

**Scalability Bottlenecks:**
```typescript
// BOTTLENECK 1: Mega-context pattern
const CompanionPanelContext = createContext<CompanionPanelContextType>()
// 1100+ lines in single context - will become performance bottleneck

// BOTTLENECK 2: String-based panel types
type PanelType = 'cart' | 'ai-assistant' | 'help'
// Should be enum for better maintainability and performance

// BOTTLENECK 3: Unbounded state growth
chatSystem: {
  mainChat: {
    messages: [...] // No cleanup mechanism
  }
}
```

### 3. **Team Scalability**

**Developer Experience Assessment:**
- ✅ **TypeScript Support**: Good type safety where implemented
- ✅ **Modern Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, Jest configured
- ✅ **Hot Reload**: React Fast Refresh compatible
