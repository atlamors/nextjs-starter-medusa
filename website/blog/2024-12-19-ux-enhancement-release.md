# UX Enhancement Release v1.1.0 üéØ

We're excited to announce the release of **Companion Panel System v1.1.0**, focused on delivering major user experience improvements and enhanced navigation patterns.

<!--truncate-->

## ‚ú® Major UX Improvements

### üîÑ History-Aware Navigation

We've completely redesigned how users navigate between panels to create a more intuitive and consistent experience:

- **Smart Trigger Buttons**: All panel trigger buttons now respect the history stack
- **Consistent Back Behavior**: Filter, AI, Help, and Cart buttons behave consistently with back buttons  
- **Context Preservation**: Clicking an active panel button goes back instead of force-closing
- **Unified Navigation Pattern**: Same behavior across all companion panel entry points

```typescript
// Example: Smart trigger button behavior
const handlePanelToggle = () => {
  if (isCurrentPanel && hasHistory) {
    goBack() // Navigate back in history
  } else {
    openPanel(panelType) // Open new panel
  }
}
```

### üõí State-Aware Cart Auto-Open

The cart auto-open feature now intelligently manages panel state transitions:

- **Previous State Restoration**: Auto-open cart remembers and restores previous panel state
- **Contextual Auto-Close**: Returns to AI assistant, filters, or help panel after cart preview
- **Smart State Detection**: Only closes entirely if no panel was open before
- **Non-Disruptive UX**: Maintains user workflow context during cart interactions

### üé® Enhanced Panel Headers

Panel headers have been redesigned for better usability:

- **Dual Navigation Options**: Filter panels now have both back and close buttons
- **Consistent Styling**: Icon-only buttons with uniform size and hover states
- **Smart Back Logic**: Back button shows "Back" or "Close" based on history state
- **Improved Accessibility**: Clear tooltips and keyboard navigation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

### üîß Layout Stability

We've addressed several layout stability issues:

- **Scrollbar Gutter**: Added `scrollbar-gutter: stable` to prevent layout shift
- **Cross-Browser Fallback**: Calculated margin compensation for older browsers
- **Modal Interaction Fix**: Sort dropdown no longer locks page scrolling

### üì± Account Page Cleanup

The account pages have received a visual refresh:

- **1-Column Login Layout**: Clean, centered login and registration forms
- **Improved Spacing**: Consistent padding and typography across auth forms
- **Better Mobile Experience**: Optimized layout for all screen sizes

## üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed React Closure Bug**: Cart auto-open state restoration now works correctly
- **Radix UI Modal Behavior**: Sort dropdown uses `modal={false}` for better UX
- **State Synchronization**: Proper cleanup of previous panel state on manual interactions

## Migration Guide

This release includes breaking changes to the navigation API. Here's how to update your code:

### Before (v1.0.x)
```typescript
const { openPanel, closePanel } = useCompanionPanel()

// Old approach - direct panel control
<button onClick={() => openPanel('cart')}>
  Open Cart
</button>
```

### After (v1.1.0)
```typescript
const { openPanel, closePanel, togglePanel } = useCompanionPanel()

// New approach - smart panel toggle
<button onClick={() => togglePanel('cart')}>
  Toggle Cart
</button>
```

## What's Next?

We're already working on the next release which will include:

- **Advanced AI Features**: Enhanced AI companion capabilities
- **Performance Optimizations**: Faster panel loading and animations
- **Accessibility Improvements**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Mobile Gestures**: Swipe navigation for mobile devices

## Upgrade Instructions

To upgrade to v1.1.0:

```bash
npm install @medusa/companion-panels@^1.1.0
# or
yarn add @medusa/companion-panels@^1.1.0
```

Then update your configuration:

```javascript
// store.config.js
export const companionPanelConfig = {
  version: '1.1.0',
  features: {
    smartNavigation: true, // Enable new navigation features
    stateAwareCart: true,  // Enable smart cart behavior
    enhancedHeaders: true, // Enable new header design
  }
}
```
