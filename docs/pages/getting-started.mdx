## Overview

The **Companion Panel System** is a revolutionary e-commerce interface pattern that transforms traditional modal interruptions into a persistent, AI-driven workflow companion.

**Enhanced with AI-Powered Companion Panel System** - Combine Medusa's modules for your commerce backend with the newest Next.js 15 features for a performant storefront. Includes an advanced companion panel system with AI shopping assistant, contextual help, and configurable features.
