# 🤖 Enhanced Companion Panel System

## Overview

The **Companion Panel System** is a revolutionary approach to e-commerce interfaces that transforms traditional modals into a persistent, AI-driven workflow companion. Instead of interrupting the user experience, panels slide out as secondary columns, creating a more immersive and productive shopping experience.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 📚 **Panel History & Navigation**
- **History Stack**: Each opened panel is saved to history (max 10 items)
- **Back Navigation**: Swipe right or press Alt+← to go back
- **Keyboard Support**: ESC to close/back, Alt+← for history navigation
- **Gesture Ready**: Perfect foundation for swipe gesture support

### 📱 **Responsive Design**
- **Mobile**: Traditional overlay modals with slide animations
- **Desktop/Tablet**: Split-view layout with content compression
- **Adaptive**: Automatically switches based on screen size

### 🔧 **Extensible Panel Types**
```typescript
type PanelType = 'cart' | 'filter' | 'aiCompanion' | 'helpCompanion' | 'productCompare' | 'wishlist' | 'reviews'
```

**Core Panels** (always available):
- `cart` - Shopping cart functionality
- `filter` - Product filtering (contextual to store pages)

**Optional Panels** (configurable via `store.config.js`):
- `aiCompanion` - AI-powered shopping assistant with chat and tickets
- `helpCompanion` - Contextual help system with search
- `productCompare` - Side-by-side product comparison
- `wishlist` - User wishlist management
- `reviews` - Product reviews and ratings

### 🎯 **Smart Context Awareness**
- **Page Detection**: Automatically shows relevant panels based on current page
- **Product Context**: Panels adapt content based on current product/category
- **User State**: Remembers panel preferences and history
- **Feature Flags**: Granular control over panel availability

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built with modern React patterns:

- **Context API**: Centralized state management
- **Custom Hooks**: `useCompanionPanel` for easy integration
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and IntelliSense
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with desktop enhancements
- **Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

## 🚀 Quick Integration

```typescript
import { useCompanionPanel } from '@/store/companion-panel'

function ProductCard({ product }) {
  const { openPanel } = useCompanionPanel()
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => openPanel('cart', { product })}>
      Add to Cart
    </button>
  )
}
```
